# Description

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and completed as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer Career Path. Everything was done from scratch, with my own knowledge and help from Codecademy Community, friends and researchs.

## How to Use

Open <>. It's a web view from reddit. It uses the [JSON API](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON) from reddit to get all data. It's not authenticated, so you cannot login and comment/share, but you can see any kind of content.
Work In Progress:
  * Comments
  * Redux implementation
  * Tests with Jest

The first page is Reddit Home. It shows the newest and trending posts from all kinds. At the right side you have a list with trending Subreddits that you can choose to filter only posts from that subreddit, or you can search for a subreddit and select it.
